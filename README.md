# Building-a-chroma-key

This is our team final project, the code was created from scrath by us.
The code works from the basics of switchng RGB to HSV, masking the video where we want to apply the code, and finally do the chroma.

To use the chroma is better run it through terminal, that way you will only need the python command and the file names, if you want to run it through Visual Studio Code or any other app you will need to do some small modifications.
